Algorithm Visualization with Map Data Project Members Work Log
(Implementing Prof Gero's recommendation of starting a work log)

Arpit:

Devayan:
**4/23**:
Added 5 changes in UI
1. Not to discredit Khaled's work, but I fixed the 'Results' section within the p #status console itself
a. aligned div #pointbox
b. aligned div #map

Both fit within the computer screen (on-campus computer)
 
2. Added map legend

3. Changed page title: Algorithm Visualization with Map Data

4. Changed the name of label, “Point Search Viz” to “Start Algorithm Visualization

5. Changed order of levels in speed might better be described as ‘Very Slow – Slow – Moderately Slow – Moderately Fast – Fast – Very Fast – Extremely Fast’ instead of ‘Painfully Slow - Slow – Pretty Slow – Medium Speed – Fast – Very Fast – Extremely Fast

Miscellaneous:
1. Uploaded Prof Teresco's handout regarding Dijkstra's Algorithm, Graph.pdf for everyone's reference (in Master branch on our Github)
2. Added Prof Gero's recommended algorithm visualization website: http://algoviz.org/catalog/entry/902 in Helpful links & Outlines.txt (in Master branch on our Github)

**4/24**:
Miscellaneous:
1. Created Project Members Work Log
2. I believe Prof Teresco had already added Arpit, Khaled and Ikhlas to the repository: TravelMapping
I forked over the repository and added all team members, just in case they were not acquainted with the TravelMapping repository.
I updated the ReadME.md in the repository.

Ikhlas:
**3/1**
I explained to the team members how to import the algorithm visualization files (.gra, .nmp etc) and demo Prof Teresco's existing 'Highway Data Examiner' website

**3/8**
I worked on the User Interface components of the website. (Even though User Interface is Khaled and Arpit's responsibility)
a. Changed title from: 'HDX (Draft Algorithm Viz): Select a file to display' to 'Clinched Highway Mapping'.

b. Added an embossed middle toolbar to bring the user's attention to the Algorithm Visualization buttons.

c. Linked a .css file to the exisiting .html file to bring about basic cascading style sheets functionality and improve the user interface experience.

d. Improved the user interface experience further by adding borders around the #map (using div functionality). Also, updated the font to be universal for all front-end text.
