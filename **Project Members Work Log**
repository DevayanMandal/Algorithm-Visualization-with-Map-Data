**4/23**:
Added 5 changes in UI
1. Not to discredit Khaled's work, but I fixed the 'Results' section within the p #status console itself
a. aligned div #pointbox
b. aligned div #map

Both fit within the computer screen (on-campus computer)
 
2. Added map legend

3. Changed page title: Algorithm Visualization with Map Data

4. Changed the name of label, “Point Search Viz” to “Start Algorithm Visualization

5. Changed order of levels in speed might better be described as ‘Very Slow – Slow – Moderately Slow – Moderately Fast – Fast – Very Fast – Extremely Fast’ instead of ‘Painfully Slow - Slow – Pretty Slow – Medium Speed – Fast – Very Fast – Extremely Fast

Miscellaneous:
1. Uploaded Prof Teresco's handout regarding Dijkstra's Algorithm, Graph.pdf for everyone's reference (in Master branch on our Github)
2. Added Prof Gero's recommended algorithm visualization website: http://algoviz.org/catalog/entry/902 in Helpful links & Outlines.txt (in Master branch on our Github)

**4/24**:
Miscellaneous:
1. Created Project Members Work Log
2. I believe Prof Teresco had already added Arpit, Khaled and Ikhlas to the repository: TravelMapping
I forked over the repository and added all team members, just in case they were not acquainted with the TravelMapping repository.
I updated the ReadME.md in the repository.
