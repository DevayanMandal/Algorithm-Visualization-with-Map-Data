Algorithm Visualization with Map Data Project Members Work Log
(Implementing Prof Gero's recommendation of starting a work log)

-------------------------------Arpit--------------------------------------

-------------------------------Devayan------------------------------------

**4/5, 4/12, 4/13 and 4/14**
Collaborated one-on-one with Ikhlas (in person and TeamViewer/Google Hangouts) to understand what changes may be required to implement the Longest/Shortest Edge Search Algorithm.
I compiled questions and doubts which were generated during the discussion and clarified those during client visits.

**4/23**:
Added 5 changes in UI
1. Not to discredit Khaled's work, but I fixed the 'Results' section within the p #status console itself
a. aligned div #pointbox
b. aligned div #map

Both fit within the computer screen (on-campus computer)
 
2. Added map legend

3. Changed page title: Algorithm Visualization with Map Data

4. Changed the name of label, “Point Search Viz” to “Start Algorithm Visualization

5. Changed order of levels in speed might better be described as ‘Very Slow – Slow – Moderately Slow – Moderately Fast – Fast – Very Fast – Extremely Fast’ instead of ‘Painfully Slow - Slow – Pretty Slow – Medium Speed – Fast – Very Fast – Extremely Fast

Miscellaneous:
1. Uploaded Prof Teresco's handout regarding Dijkstra's Algorithm, Graph.pdf for everyone's reference (in Master branch on our Github)

2. Added Prof Gero's recommended algorithm visualization website: http://algoviz.org/catalog/entry/902 in Helpful links & Outlines.txt (in Master branch on our Github)

**4/24**:
Miscellaneous:
1. Created Project Members Work Log

2. I believe Prof Teresco had already added Arpit, Khaled and Ikhlas to the repository: TravelMapping
I forked over the repository and added all team members, just in case they were not acquainted with the TravelMapping repository.
I updated the ReadME.md in the repository.

3. Editted and added 2 documents:
 a. Algorithm - Dijkstra's Description Pseudocode
 b. Algorithm - Extreme Waypoint Search Description Pseudocode
 
Khaled and Arpit haven been requested via Whatsapp to only copy-paste these documents (preserving the format) for each respective Pseudocode window.

-------------------------------Ikhlas-------------------------------------

**3/1**
I explained to the team members how to import the algorithm visualization files (.gra, .nmp etc) and demo Prof Teresco's existing 'Highway Data Examiner' website

**3/8**
I worked on the User Interface components of the website. (Even though User Interface is Khaled and Arpit's responsibility)
a. Changed title from: 'HDX (Draft Algorithm Viz): Select a file to display' to 'Clinched Highway Mapping'.

b. Added an embossed middle toolbar to bring the user's attention to the Algorithm Visualization buttons.

c. Linked a .css file to the exisiting .html file to bring about basic cascading style sheets functionality and improve the user interface experience.

d. Improved the user interface experience further by adding borders around the #map (using div functionality). Also, updated the font to be universal for all front-end text.

**4/13**
1. Discussed with the client (via email and Arpit, Devayan and Khaled met the client during office hours) as to how the Longest/Shortest Edge Search Algorithm will be implemented:
a. Understood the purpose of the algorithm
b. Understood the pseudocode involved
c. Understood what segments of the .js and .html file might need require changes

2. Added the 'Pseudocode' button in the middle toolbar. Integrated the functionality of the same with the .js and .css file.

**4/14**
a. Worked on implementing the above 3 points at home.
b. Discussed further with the client (via email) about implementation of the algorithm.

**4/15**
Worked on implementing the above 3 points at home.
Additions/deletions/changes/improvements: comments made in the .js, .html, .css files on Github (Can be accessed by viewing history of each of those files)

**4/17**
Worked on implementing the above 3 points at home.
Additions/deletions/changes/improvements: comments made in the .js, .html, .css files on Github (Can be accessed by viewing history of each of those files)

**4/18**
a. Finished implementing the above 3 points at home.
b. Integrated the Longest/Shortest Edge Search Algorithm into the exisiting project files.
